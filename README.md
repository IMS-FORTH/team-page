# 🌐 GeoSat ReSeArch Lab – Interns GitHub Team Page

Welcome to the official team page for the 2025 Internship Program at the **GeoSat ReSeArch Lab**, IMS-FORTH.

This project serves as a collaborative GitHub Page for all interns to introduce themselves, showcase their work, and link to their **individual GitHub Pages** (personal portfolios including CVs and projects). It is a great opportunity to gain experience in version control, GitHub collaboration, and personal branding in research and development.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Create a **collaborative GitHub Page** introducing the intern team.
- Link to each intern’s **personal GitHub Page** (which must include a CV and optionally other projects).
- Learn the basics of Git, GitHub Pages, markdown, and collaboration workflows.

---

## ✅ Each Intern Must

1. **Create a Personal GitHub Page**  
   - Fork or create a new GitHub repository named:  
     `yourusername.github.io`
   - Include your **CV** (as PDF or Markdown).
   - Optionally, add sections for projects, blog posts, or interests.
   - Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings.

2. **Add Yourself to the Team Page**
   - Clone this repository (team page repo).
   - In the main `index.html`, add a short profile card or list item with:
     - Your full name
     - A short bio
     - A link to your personal GitHub Page (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io)
       
       **in the latest version the card is added dynamically by pulling from the data.json
       Edit the data.json to include an object for yourself.
       Object parameters (name/value pairs) needed are
       "name", "school", "job", "bio", "profileImg", "githubLink", "cv", and "arrivalDate".
       
       "cv" being the link to your personal GitHub Page (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io)
  
       Update the README.md if needed
       
      - Commit and push your changes to the main branch of this repository.
